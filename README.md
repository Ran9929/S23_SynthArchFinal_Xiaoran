# Synth Arch Final

 I utilized the Unity VR Interaction Framework to create a small playground. Player can use unity and quest link to play with it. It features climbable railings and a zipline to help players cross over lava. The central aspect of the entire structure is a deformable particle matrix that I developed. Additionally, there is a small shooting range.
